The fish swam in the pond.
The frog jumped into the water.
The fish hid under a rock.
The frog splashed and made ripples.
The pond was surrounded by green plants.
The fish and the frog shared the pond.
The plants by the pond were very tall.
The sun shone over the water.
The dragonfly flew above the pond.
The dragonfly hovered near the plants.
The dragonfly enjoyed resting on a leaf.
The pond sparkled in the sunlight.
