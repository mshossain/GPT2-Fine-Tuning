The rabbit hopped in the garden.
The squirrel ran up the tree.
The rabbit hid among the flowers.
The squirrel chattered and waved its tail.
The garden was full of colorful flowers.
The rabbit and the squirrel played together.
The flowers bloomed under the sun.
The butterfly fluttered over the flowers.
The butterfly landed on a petal.
The butterfly enjoyed the scent of the flowers.
The rabbit sniffed the fresh leaves.
The squirrel watched the butterfly fly.
